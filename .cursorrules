# Gridiron Rampage 3D - Cursor Rules

You are assisting with the development of Gridiron Rampage 3D, an arcade-style 3D street football game built with React Three Fiber.

## Code Style

- Use functional components with hooks, not class components
- Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- Use 2-space indentation, single quotes, and semicolons
- Group imports: React, Three.js/R3F, other libraries, internal components, styles
- Add comments for complex physics calculations and game logic

## Development Patterns

- Use Zustand for state management (see store.jsx for structure)
- Use refs for direct manipulation of Three.js objects
- Use useFrame for animations and physics updates
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Avoid physics calculations directly in render loops
- Separate game logic from rendering logic
- Use componentization for reusable game elements
- Prefer mesh instancing for repeated objects

## Three.js/R3F Specific

- Use React Three Fiber patterns for all Three.js code
- Use Drei helpers when appropriate (e.g., PerspectiveCamera, Environment)
- Implement proper physics with custom solutions or React Three Rapier
- Be mindful of performance - use instancing, proper cleanup, and LOD
- For models, use simple primitives or optimized GLTFs

## Game Mechanics Implementation

- Football physics: use physics-based calculations for trajectory and bounce
- Rage Meter: accumulate points based on player actions
- Wall interactions: detect wall proximity for special moves
- Player controls: implement responsive movement with proper acceleration
- AI opponents: path-finding and decision-making based on game situation

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch blocks for audio, physics, and user interactions
- Log errors to console during development
- Handle missing assets gracefully
- Implement fallbacks for physics errors

## Project Structure

- Keep components organized by domain function (player, field, UI)
- Store 3D assets in the public/models directory
- Keep game state centralized in the Zustand store
- Use proper typing patterns (PropTypes or TypeScript)
